    <h1>the story of cats</h1>
    <hr />
    <br />
    The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It
    is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred
    to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the
    family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat; the
    latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.

    <h2>Etymology and naming</h2>
    <br />
    The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the
    Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th
    century. It was suggested that the word 'cattus' is derived from an Egyptian
    precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau, "tomcat", or its feminine form suffixed with
    -t. The Late Latin word may be derived from another Afro-Asiatic or
    Nilo-Saharan language. The Nubian word kaddîska "wildcat" and Nobiin kadīs
    are possible sources or cognates. The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic
    قَطّ‎ qaṭṭ ~ قِطّ qiṭṭ. It is "equally likely that the forms might derive
    from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and thence to Greek and
    to Syriac and Arabic". The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern
    European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern
    Sami gáđfi, "female stoat", and Hungarian hölgy, "lady, female stoat"; from
    Proto-Uralic *käďwä, "female (of a furred animal)". The English puss,
    extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may
    have been introduced from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related
    to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt. Similar forms exist in
    Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín. The etymology of this word is
    unknown, but it may have simply arisen from a sound used to attract a cat. A
    male cat is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered). An unspayed
    female is called a queen, (or a molly, if spayed), especially in a
    cat-breeding context. A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten. In Early
    Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete
    word catling. A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder or a glaring.
